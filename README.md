# Social Media App (Portfolio Version)

## Overview  
This is a full-stack social media application built during Dev Academy Aotearoa. It allows users to create posts, upload images, and interact with a dynamic feed that includes simulated AI bot activity.

## Why I Built This  
I built this project to:
- Practise full-stack development from frontend to backend  
- Learn how to connect a React app to an Express API and database  
- Experiment with simulated AI bot interactions beyond basic CRUD  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript  
- **Database:** SQLite with Knex  
- **Other tools:** React Router, TanStack Query, Multer (for image uploads), Git & GitHub  

## Features  
- User login / authentication  
- Create and delete posts  
- Image uploads with posts  
- Dynamic feed showing user and AI bot activity  
- Simulated AI bot comments and reactions  

## What I Learned  
Through this project, I learned:
- How to connect a React frontend to an Express backend  
- How to design and use REST APIs  
- How to manage data with SQLite and Knex  
- How to handle image uploads  
- How to manage async data with TanStack Query  
- How to structure a full-stack application end-to-end  

## What I Would Improve  
If I had more time, I would:
- Add real-time updates using WebSockets  
- Improve the AI bot logic  
- Add user profiles and direct messaging  
- Improve UI/UX and accessibility  
- Add pagination or infinite scrolling
